The product arrived late and the packaging was damaged. I opened the box to find scratches on the item. I reached out to customer support via email but did not receive any response for 5 days. The product itself seems fine but I am unhappy with the delivery experience and the lack of communication. I would like a replacement or a refund. Overall this has been stressful and disappointing. Please improve the packing and response time of support.
